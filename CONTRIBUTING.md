## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- JUCE 7.0.12 (included as submodule)
- CMake 3.15+
- C++17 compiler (Xcode/GCC/MSVC)

### Building for Development

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheRustySpoon/FreeEQ8.git
cd FreeEQ8

# macOS
./build_macos.sh

# Windows
.\build_windows.ps1
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### C++ Style
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Opening braces on the same line for functions/classes
- Use descriptive variable names
- Prefer `const` where applicable
- Use modern C++17 features

### Example:
```cpp
void MyClass::processAudio(float* buffer, int numSamples)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < numSamples; ++i)
    {
        float sample = buffer[i];
        // Process sample...
        buffer[i] = sample;
    }
}
```

### Comments
- Use `//` for single-line comments
- Use `/* */` for multi-line comments
- Document complex DSP algorithms
- Explain "why" not "what"

### File Organization
```
Source/
├── PluginProcessor.h      # Audio processor interface
├── PluginProcessor.cpp    # Audio processing implementation
├── PluginEditor.h         # UI interface
├── PluginEditor.cpp       # UI implementation
└── DSP/
    ├── Biquad.h           # Filter implementations
    └── EQBand.h           # Band logic
```

## Testing

Before submitting:
1. Build on your platform without warnings
2. Test in at least one DAW
3. Verify parameter automation works
4. Test state save/restore
5. Check for audio glitches/clicks
6. Test extreme parameter values

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Plugin loads in DAW
- [ ] All parameters respond correctly
- [ ] No audio artifacts (clicks, pops)
- [ ] CPU usage is reasonable
- [ ] State saves/restores properly
- [ ] UI updates reflect parameter changes
- [ ] No crashes or hangs
